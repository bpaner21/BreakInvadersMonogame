	Break Invaders

* Short Description:
	A desktop arcade game combining the mechanics of Breakout and Space Invaders.

* Long Description:
	The goal of the game is to clear as many levels as possible by destroying 5 rows by 11 column waves of invading aliens by using a ball reflected off a paddle. When all the invaders in a wave are destroyed, excluding mother ships, which are automatically destroyed as a new level is set up, the ball and paddle positions are reset and a new wave of aliens is generated. 

Use the left and right arrow keys to move your paddle across the bottom of the screen. Pressing the space or up arrow key launches the ball and initiates gameplay. Game action is paused while the ball is on the paddle and out of play, allowing for the player a certain degree of strategy by aiming the initial path of the ball. Press the enter key to restart the game after a game over.

Aliens are destroyed by colliding with the ball, which bounces off active invaders and the top and side edges of the screen. Each destroyed invader awards the player 100 points. Players have the opportunity to earn a randomly chosen of bonus points by destroying any UFO mother ships that wander onscreen. The ball can also bounce of the top of the player's paddle, but if the player misses and the ball moves past the bottom of the screen, the player loses a life and the ball is reset. Once the player dies after losing all three lives, the game is over.

Each row alternately moves incrementally to one side until every row reaches the edge of the screen. Following that, each row alternately moves down, and they begin moving towards the opposite side, repeating this cycle as they reach the bottom of the screen. As the invaders repeat this cycle, the movement speed increases, until a maximum speed is reached. The initial speed of movement is also increased as each new wave of aliens are destroyed. Should any invader reach below a certain vertical threshold, the player gets an instant game over.

As the invaders move, the invaders randomly shoot at the player, to a maximum of five shots onscreen at any given time. if any of these shots hit the player's paddle, the player loses a life and the ball is reset. Players are protected from these shots by four bunkers standing between the paddle and the invaders. Each of the 16 section of the bunkers can take two shots from the invaders before being destroyed, protecting the invader from a maximum of 128 shots per level. Each time the player moves onto a new level, the bunkers are reset.
